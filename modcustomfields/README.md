# Custom fields for activity modules #

This plugin adds the ability to create custom fields for activity modules.

Custom fields are created "globally" on the site administration and will be available to all activity modules.

Each activity module can then use this fields as they like.

The fields and their data can also be used in configurable reports, for example.
